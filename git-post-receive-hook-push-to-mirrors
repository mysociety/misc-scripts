# GitHub exposes the user that pushed rather more than I think it
# should - usually the pusher is uninteresting compared to the author
# or committer.  However, because GitHub shows the generic
# "mysociety-pusher" user in the activity log, among other places,
# people have requested the push should appear to come from
# themselves.  We want to transition smoothly to this for people who
# care about that, so we check if an alias called GitHubAsMe exists in
# their ~/.ssh/config, and if so, use that instead.

# The ~/.ssh/config should look like:
#
# Host GitHubAsMe
#   Hostname=github.com
#   User=git
#   IdentityFile=/home/mark/.ssh/id_rsa
#
# ... where the user should make sure the IdentityFile is the private
# key corresponding to a public key they have added to their personal
# GitHub account's SSH keys.
