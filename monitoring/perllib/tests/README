Individual monitoring components. Each should consist of a perl module which
defines a single test() function; that function should print information about
any test failures it encounters to standard output. Tests are run in a
subprocess, connected to the monitoring program by a pipe. Tests will be timed
out by the monitoring process after a while, but should try to detect timeouts
themselves.
