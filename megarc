# Script to execute the "megarc" binary for LINUX ONLY
# This script opens a node at run time. It gets the major
# no of the megadev and then opens a node with the major number.
# If the node is already present, it removes the node first
# and then creates a fresh node.
# The binary "megarc.bin" must be present in the same directoy
# where the script is invoked from.


# Get the major number of the megadev ioctl node
MAJOR=`grep megadev /proc/devices|awk '{print $1}'`

	rm -f /dev/megadev0 	# remove if already there, ignore if not.
	mknod /dev/megadev0  c $MAJOR 0
