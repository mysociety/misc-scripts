# Succeeds if no local changes have been made to a git repository,
# including submodules recursively, and it's safe to checkout a
# given new commit.
#
# Parameters are:
# $1 - directory of git repository checkout
# $2 - git ref to check against - name of ref (object name, a tag, or the
#      remote-tracking branch name) in git.  If this is not supplied,
#      then only checking for local modifications is done
