  disable-email activate|deactivate|fail

  Simple script designed to activate/deactivate mail when .forward* files are used.

  Run this script as the user you wish to modify with arguments as follows:

  activate
    - moves all files in $USER's homedir matching the pattern .forward* to *.bak
    - replaces the originals with '|/data/mysociety/bin/disable-email fail'

  deactivate
    - restores files matching .forward*.bak to their original locations

  fail
    - exits with 75

  Any other invocation should print this and exit 75.

  echo "$HELP_TEXT"
  exit 75
