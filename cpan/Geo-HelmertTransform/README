Geo-HelmertTransform

Perform Helmert transforms (linear transformations between coordinate datums).
These are used (for instance) to transform geographical coordinates between the
WGS84 datum used in GPS, and the Airy 1830 datum used in British Ordnance
Survey mapping.

See the documentation for Geo::HelmertTransform for more information.
