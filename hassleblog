*** IT COULD BE YOU ***
    -- and, as it turned out, it was

It's time to write a post on the mySociety web log, or the
mySociety developers' web log, as appropriate. Please do so
now. Write a hundred words or so, unless you're feeling
inspired to greater things, and write about what you were
doing immediately before this email interrupted you, unless
you have something more interesting to remark on.

If you really can't be arsed to write something, hassle
someone else to do so.

Remember: YOUR PUBLIC NEEDS YOU
